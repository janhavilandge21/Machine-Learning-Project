# 📊 Interactive ML Project with Filtering & Hyperparameters

This project is an interactive Streamlit application that demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Regression, Clustering, and Classification techniques with dynamic filtering and hyperparameter tuning.

It is designed as a learning-friendly and interactive tool for beginners and intermediate ML practitioners.

🚀 Features

📈 EDA: Correlation heatmap, summary statistics, and feature distributions.

🔮 Regression: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVR with hyperparameter tuning.

🧩 Clustering: KMeans, Agglomerative, and DBSCAN clustering with visualizations.

🎯 Classification: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM with performance metrics.

⚡ Interactive UI: Filter dataset ranges and control model hyperparameters directly from the sidebar.

✅ Overfitting/Underfitting Detection: Built-in checks for model performance.
