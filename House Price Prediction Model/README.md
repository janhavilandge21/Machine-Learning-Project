#  📌 Simple Linear Regression Model
📖 Overview

This project demonstrates a Simple Linear Regression model to predict [e.g., salary based on years of experience / house price based on size].
It shows the basic workflow of training, testing, and visualizing a regression model.

📊 Dataset

Source: [Kaggle / UCI / Custom dataset]

Features:

Independent variable (X): [e.g., Years of Experience]

Dependent variable (y): [e.g., Salary]

🛠️ Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-linear-regression.git
cd simple-linear-regression
pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 How to Run
1. Train the Model
python train.py

2. Predict with the Model
python predict.py

3. Run the Streamlit App (optional)
streamlit run app.py

📈 Results

Algorithm: Simple Linear Regression

Model Equation: y = mX + c

Example Output:

Input (X = 5 years experience) → Predicted Salary = 60,000
